### Steps to build and run
- Run `make all` from the root directory of the project.
- It will create a `build` directory in the root directory of the project and create all executables in it.
- The name of the executables are based on the question number in the assignment. So the executable generated with solution for Question 2 will be `./build/question2`.
- Run the executable corresponding to the question number to see the result. A sample command is `./build/question2 ABCDEFGHIJ 3 4`
